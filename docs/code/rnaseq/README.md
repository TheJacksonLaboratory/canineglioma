This directory **only** hosts code files that are otherwise not detailed under figure-specific code blocks, e.g., [F1A](/figures/F1A), [F2A](/figures/F2A), etc. Please note that code inside this directory is given to show run-time parameters, and it is unlikely to run *off-the-shelf* as code is tailored for our cluster environment.
