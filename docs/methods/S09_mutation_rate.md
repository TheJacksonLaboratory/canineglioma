title: Somatic Mutation Rate
noindex: true
---

Somatic mutations (SNVs and Indels) rate was estimated within coding genes and adjusted based on relative per-base coverage with minimum coverage of 30X in coding regions (Figure 1D). Coding mutation rates for human pediatric (n=961) and adult cancers (n=3,800, includes 811 adult gliomas) were taken from published studies (Ceccarelli et al., 2016; Gr√∂bner et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018).
