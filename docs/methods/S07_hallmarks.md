title: Cancer Hallmarks Analysis

Cancer hallmarks were defined according to published ten hallmarks (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) and one additional hallmark, i.e. epigenetic (Imielinski et al., 2012). A pool of known glioma and pan-cancer driver genes (Ceccarelli et al. 2016; Gröbner et al., 2018; Bailey et al. 2018) were mapped to hallmarks following a previously published computer-assisted manual curation method (Table S4) (Iorio et al., 2018). Total five cohorts were defined, i.e. IDHwt- (n=371), IDHmut-codel (n=169) and IDHmut-noncodel (n=268) subgroups in human adult gliomas (AG) (Ceccarelli et al. 2016), human pediatric glioma (PG) (Gröbner et al. 2016) and canine glioma (CG). For each of the five cohorts coding mutations were mapped to eleven hallmarks and coverage adjusted relative proportions of patients harboring an alteration in a given hallmark were calculated. For comparisons between cohorts a two-sided Fisher’s exact test was applied (Table S5).
