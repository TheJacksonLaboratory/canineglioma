Cancer hallmarks were defined according to published ten hallmarks (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) and one additional hallmark, i.e. epigenetic (Imielinski et al., 2012). A pool of 268 known glioma (Ceccarelli et al., 2016; Mackay et al., 2017) and pan-cancer driver genes (Gröbner et al., 2018; Bailey et al. 2018) were mapped to hallmarks following a previously published computer-assisted manual curation method (Table S4) (Iorio et al., 2018). Based on WHO molecular classification of brain tumors, somatic SNV and copy-number data from patients with human adult gliomas (AG) (Ceccarelli et al., 2016) were stratified into IDHwt (n=373), IDHmut-codel (n=169) and IDHmut-noncodel (n=268) subgroups while corresponding data from patients with human pediatric glioma (PG) (Mackay et al., 2017) were subgrouped based on mutations in Histone H3 gene, namely H3mut (n=200) and H3wt (n=126). For canine patients with glioma (CG), we used somatic mutations and copy-number calls from 67 cases with paired tumor-normal samples. For each of the six cohorts coding mutations were mapped to eleven hallmarks and coverage adjusted relative proportions of patients harboring an alteration in a given hallmark were calculated. For comparisons between cohorts a two-sided Fisher’s exact test was applied (Table S5).
