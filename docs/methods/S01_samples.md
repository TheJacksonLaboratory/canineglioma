Tissue samples from canine patients with gliomas were acquired with material transfer agreements from Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine, Colorado State University, Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and Virginia-MD College of Veterinary Medicine. Tissue samples from resected tumor (n=83) and matched normal tissue (n=67 or paired cases) were collected at the surgical treatment or immediately following euthanasia. There were also four additional dog patients where we had adequate DNA and RNA for methylation (n=48) and RNA-seq (n=40) profiling but unable to do WGS/Exome sequencing because of failed library preparation (see Table S1). Matched normal tissue were from post-necropsy sample of contra-lateral healthy brain tissue (n=38), white blood cells (n=13), and remaining 17 samples from other tissues. Samples were archived in snap-frozen (n=37/67 paired cases; n=8/16 tumor-only cases) and Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE, n=30/67 paired cases; n=8/16 tumor-only cases) state. Samples were then shipped to sequencing core facilities for sample preparation, quality control and sequencing (see Methods below).
