SMG analysis in canine gliomas (Figure 1A, 1C, 2A) with paired tumor-normal samples (n=57) was performed using dNdS (Martincorena et al., 2017) and MuSiC2 (version 0.2) (Dees et al., 2012). We excluded tumor-only cases for being conservative in SMG analysis and minimize false-positives. Also, MuSiC2 required matched normal tissue required matched normal tissue for SMG analysis. Detailed parameters for SMG analysis are in extended methods. Detailed output from both methods in respectively in table S2 and table S3.
