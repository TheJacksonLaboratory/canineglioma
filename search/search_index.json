CCF per somatic snv was a product of variant allelic fraction (VAF) of a somatic snv, adjusted by local copy number of gene locus and whole tumor sample (ploidy) as well as purity estimate (tumor cell content) inferred from TitanCNA algorithm (Detailed under copy number estimation section above). A clonal (early) vs subclonal (late) mutation was then classified based on upper boundary of CCF was above 0.95 (clonal) or not (subclonal). Second, we timed copy number gain and copy-neutral LOH regions based on VAF of somatic snvs in these copy regions, i.e., early mutations prior to copy gain will have higher VAF relative to VAF of late mutations after copy gain. Third, we ordered mutations in four sequential categories: early clonal, early subclonal, late clonal, and late subclonal. We note here that early subclonal and late clonal categories are result of underlying parallel and/or convergent evolution of multiple clones (Venkatesan and Swanton, 2016) and/or a technical limitation (given ~60X depth of merged bam files and lack of spatial sequencing data) in resolving polyclonal structure of a tumor sample (Deshwar et al., 2015). We then tally frequency of each of these four categories per somatic driver mutation and get the average frequency of each category per driver mutation at cohort (canine, pediatric, adult) level. These average frequencies are converted to winning tables, similar to sports statistics where each driver mutation competes with remaining driver mutations with winning being an early somatic event based on order of events using clonality (Jolly and Van Loo, 2018) (step 3). Finally, a winning table is then passed to Bradley-Terry model ( BradleyTerryScalable R package, version 0.1.0.9000; https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BradleyTerryScalable/vignettes/BradleyTerryScalable.html ) to estimate winning probability (driver event being an early event) based on a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate. Resulting winning probability per driver mutation is subtracted from 1 to plot multiple density plots (ggridges R package, version: 0.5.1.9000) with X-axis now showing a probability of event being a late event (Figure 3D).

The methylation categories designated as regression outcome variables were derived from the World Health Organization classification of gliomas: IDH-wildtype adult glioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-intact adult glioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted adult glioma, adult normal control, pediatric glioma, and pediatric normal control.

For each region, every fourth field was imaged (25%) on high-power field (20x) and resulted in 21 to 274 fields per slide, which varies according to the size of the tissue and presence or absence of necrosis. For the training set, heterogeneous fields were randomly selected to include tissue, non-tissue and damaged areas. Hematoxylin and DAB was used to identify the nuclei. Positive and negative cells were distinguished visually and three optical densities (OD) thresholds were set accordingly. The thresholds allowed 4-bin (0 = negative, +1 = weak positive, +2 = intermediate, +3 = strong positive) sorting of cells depending on the positivity and its intensity. The intermediate positivity threshold was calculated as the midpoint after setting the lower and higher threshold.

The immunohistochemistry panel included those antibodies that have been documented to work in canine tissues and include myeloid microglia/macrophages (IBA1), monocytes (CD14) and their M2 skew subtype (CD163), and lymphoid T cells (CD3) and B cells (CD79a). Slides with 5um sections, were deparaffinized and rehydrated in a dry incubator (60\u00b0C for 1 hour), xylene, and histological grade ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer and a pressure cooker at 120\u00b0C23 for 12 minutes. Quenching for endogenous peroxidase was performed with 3% H2O2 for 15 minutes at room temperature. Non-specific binding was minimized using ready-to-use protein blocker (Dako) applied for 15 minutes before the application of the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. All the washing was done using 1x T-PBS buffer mixed with 0.1% Tween 20. The biotinylated secondary antibody was applied for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by three washes with buffer for 5 minutes each. Color development was performed using the DAKO DAB kit and color change was monitored until an appropriate detectable level was achieved (10-60 sec depending on the antibody). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin (25 seconds) and bluing buffer, then rehydrated and cover-slipped with long lasting mounting solution. The immunohistochemistry quantification were done blindly relative to the tumor pathology.","title":"Immunohistochemistry"},{"location":"methods/S16_expression_immune/#scanning-and-tissue-segmentation","text":"Scanning and analysis were performed using the PerkinElmer Vectra Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System and the inForm Cell Analysis software (ver 2.4). Slides were scanned twice on low- and high-power fields as follows: the first scan was of the whole slide on low power field (10x) for manual tissue segmentation to identify three tumor regions/categories as necrotic center, tumor and invasive edge under the neuropathologist\u2019s supervision/direction. For each region, every fourth field was imaged (25%) on high-power field (20x) and resulted in 21 to 274 fields per slide, which varies according to the size of the tissue and presence or absence of necrosis. For the training set, heterogeneous fields were randomly selected to include tissue, non-tissue and damaged areas. Hematoxylin and DAB was used to identify the nuclei. Positive and negative cells were distinguished visually and three optical densities (OD) thresholds were set accordingly. The thresholds allowed 4-bin (0 = negative, +1 = weak positive, +2 = intermediate, +3 = strong positive) sorting of cells depending on the positivity and its intensity. The intermediate positivity threshold was calculated as the midpoint after setting the lower and higher threshold. The algorithm of the training set was applied for all the high-power fields captured. The results were inspected and the nonspecific and defective fields were removed before compiling the dataset. The same process was applied for all seven markers.","title":"Scanning and tissue segmentation"},{"location":"methods/S16_expression_immune/#cibersort-based-expression-analysis","text":"Processed RNA-seq expression matrices from canine (n=40; 25 HGG, 14 LGG, 1 unknown grade), adult (n=703; 529 LGG, 174 GBM), and pediatric glioma (n=92; 42 LGG, 50 HGG) were each run as separate jobs into the CIBERSORT webserver ( https://cibersort.stanford.edu ) and processed in relative mode using the following parameters: Signature Genes: LM22 CIBERSORT default, Permutations run: 100, Quantile normalization disabled (Newman et al., 2015).
